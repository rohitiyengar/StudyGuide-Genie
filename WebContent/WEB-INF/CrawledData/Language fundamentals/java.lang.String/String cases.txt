The String class also allows for the modification of cases. The two methods that make this possible are toLowerCase() and toUpperCase().
These methods are useful to do a search which is not case sensitive:

Write the String getDisplayName(String) method that receives the mail string as parameter and returns the readable person name like this: LASTNAME Firstname
