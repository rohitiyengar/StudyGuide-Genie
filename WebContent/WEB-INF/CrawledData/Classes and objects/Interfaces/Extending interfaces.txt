An interface can extend several interfaces, similar to the way that a class can extend another class, using the extends keyword:
This way, a class implementing the InterfaceAB interface has to implement the methodA(), the methodB() and the otherMethod() methods:
Doing so, a ClassAB object can be casted into InterfaceA, InterfaceB and InterfaceAB.
Question 4.2
: Consider the following interfaces.
List all the methods that an implementing class of Movable should implement.
Question 4.3
: Consider the following classes and the following code.
Change the implementation of the code in order to be able to uncomment the commented line without compile error.
You have to create an interface that defines the method printLog(String) and makes ConsoleLogger and FileLogger implement it:
Now your code has to cast the objects to the Logger type and then you can uncomment the code.
