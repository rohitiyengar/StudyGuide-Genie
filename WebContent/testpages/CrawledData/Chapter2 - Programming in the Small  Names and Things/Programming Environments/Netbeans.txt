Another IDE for professional programming is NetBeans. It can be downloaded from netbeans.org. Alternatively, a bundle containing both NetBeans and the JDK is available on Oracle's Java download page.

Using NetBeans is very similar to using Eclipse. Even the layout of its window is very similar to the Eclipse window. Create a project in NetBeans with the "New Project" command. You will have to select the type of project in a pop-up window. You want to create a "Java Application." The project creation dialog will have a suggested name for the project, which you will want to change. It also has an option to create a main class for the project, which is selected by default. If you use that option, you should change the class name. For use with this book, the name should not be in a "package"; that is, it should not include a period.

A project will have a "Source Folder" where the source code files for the project are stored. You can drag TextIO.java and other files onto that folder, or you can copy-and-paste them from the file system. For running a file, you can right-click the file and select "Run File" from the pop-up menu. There is also a "Run" button in the NetBeans toolbar. There is no explicit compilation step. Input and ouput are done in an area below the edit window, just as in Eclipse.

When you are editing a file, NetBeans will mark errors as you type. (Remember, again, that many errors will go away on their own as you continue to type.) If NetBeans displays an error marker with a light bulb in the left-hand margin of the editor, you have to click the light bulb to get a list of possible automatic fixes for the error. NetBeans also has a "Code Completion" feature that is similar to Content Assist in Eclipse. Just press Control-Space as you are typing to get a list of possible completions.`
