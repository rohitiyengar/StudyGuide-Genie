One application of switch statements is in processing menus. A menu is a list of options. The user selects one of the options. The computer has to respond to each possible choice in a different way. If the options are numbered 1, 2, ..., then the number of the chosen option can be used in a switch statement to select the proper response.

In a TextIO-based program, the menu can be presented as a numbered list of options, and the user can choose an option by typing in its number. Here is an example that could be used in a variation of the LengthConverter example from the previous section:

int optionNumber;   // Option number from menu, selected by user.
double measurement; // A numerical measurement, input by the user.
                    //    The unit of measurement depends on which
                    //    option the user has selected.
double inches;      // The same measurement, converted into inches.

/* Display menu and get user's selected option number. */

System.out.println("What unit of measurement does your input use?");
System.out.println();
System.out.println("         1.  inches");
System.out.println("         2.  feet");
System.out.println("         3.  yards");
System.out.println("         4.  miles");
System.out.println();
System.out.println("Enter the number of your choice: ");
optionNumber = TextIO.getlnInt();

/* Read user's measurement and convert to inches. */

switch ( optionNumber ) {
   case 1:
       System.out.println("Enter the number of inches: ");
       measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       inches = measurement;
       break;          
   case 2:
       System.out.println("Enter the number of feet: ");
       measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       inches = measurement * 12;
       break;          
   case 3:
       System.out.println("Enter the number of yards: ");
       measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       inches = measurement * 36;
       break;          
   case 4:
       System.out.println("Enter the number of miles: ");
       measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       inches = measurement * 12 * 5280;
       break;
   default:
       System.out.println("Error!  Illegal option number!  I quit!");
       System.exit(1);          
} // end switch

/* Now go on to convert inches to feet, yards, and miles... */
This example could instead be written using a String in the switch statement:

String units;       // Unit of measurement, entered by user.
double measurement; // A numerical measurement, input by the user.
double inches;      // The same measurement, converted into inches.

/* Read the user's unit of measurement. */

System.out.println("What unit of measurement does your input use?");
System.out.print("Legal responses: inches, feet, yards, or miles : ");
units = TextIO.getln().toLowerCase();

/* Read user's measurement and convert to inches. */

System.out.print("Enter the number of " + units + ":  ");
measurement = TextIO.getlnDouble();

switch ( units ) {
   case "inches":
       inches = measurement;
       break;          
   case "feet":
       inches = measurement * 12;
       break;          
   case "yards":
       inches = measurement * 36;
       break;          
   case "miles":
       inches = measurement * 12 * 5280;
       break;
   default:
       System.out.println("Wait a minute!  Illegal unit of measure!  I quit!");
       System.exit(1);          
} // end switch
