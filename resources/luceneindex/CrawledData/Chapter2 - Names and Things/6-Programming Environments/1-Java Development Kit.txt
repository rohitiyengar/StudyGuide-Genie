The basic development system for Java programming is usually referred to as the JDK (Java Development Kit). It is a part of Java SE, the Java "Standard Edition" (as opposed to Java EE for servers or Java ME for mobile devices). Note that Java SE comes in two versions, a Development Kit version (the JDK) and a Runtime Environment version (the JRE). The Runtime can be used to run Java programs, but it does not allow you to compile your own Java programs. The Development Kit includes the Runtime but also lets you compile programs. You need a JDK for use with this textbook.

Java was developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc., which is now a part of the Oracle corporation. Oracle makes the JDK for Windows, Mac OX, and Linux available for free download at its Java Web site. Many Windows computers come with a Java Runtime already installed, but you might need to install the JDK. Some versions of Linux come with the JDK either installed by default or on the installation media. Mac OS does not currently come with Java pre-installed. If you need to download and install the JDK, be sure to get the JDK for Java 7, Java 8, or later. As of summer, 2014, it can be downloaded from

If a JDK is properly installed on your computer, you can use the command line environment to compile and run Java programs. An IDE will also require a JDK, but it might be included with the IDE download.
