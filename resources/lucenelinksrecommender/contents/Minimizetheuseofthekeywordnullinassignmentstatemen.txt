This means not doing things like: Code section 6.17: Declaring an exception. 
 1 String s = null;
 2 while (something) {
 3     if (something2) {
 4         s = "yep";
 5     }
 6 }
 7 
 8 if (s != null) {
 9     something3(s);
10 }
 You can replace this with: Code section 6.18: Declaring an exception. 
1 boolean done = false;
2 
3 while (!done && something) {
4     if (something2) {
5        done = true;
6        something3("yep");
7     }
8 }
 You might also consider replacing null with "" in the first example, but default values bring about bugs caused by default values being left in place. A NullPointerException is actually better, as it allows the runtime to tell you about the bug, rather than just continue with a default value.
