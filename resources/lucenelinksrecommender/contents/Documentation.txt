The JDK provides a tool named javadoc which allows to generate the documentation of the well commented classes. The javadoc command without argument give the complete syntax of the command.Example : for a class named Example defined in a package named org.wikibooks.en dans le fichier C:\ProgJava\org\wikibooks\en\Example.java :The documentation can be generated in a specific folder (C:\ProgDoc for example) with the following command:The options of this command are described below:-locale en_US The documentation in US English. -use Create the pages about the use of the classes and the packages. -classpath C:\ProgJava The path of the compiled classes (*.class). -sourcepath C:\ProgJava The path of the source classes (*.java). -d C:\ProgDoc The path where the documentation must be generated. org.wikibooks.en The name of the package to document. It is possible to specify several packages, or one or several class names to document only those ones.The description page of a package copy the description text from the file named package.html which should be placed in the given folder. In our example, we should document the package in the file C:\ProgJava\org\wikibooks\en\package.html.Since Java 5[1], the package.html file can be replaced by a special Java file named package-info.java containing only the package declaration preceding by a documentation comment.
