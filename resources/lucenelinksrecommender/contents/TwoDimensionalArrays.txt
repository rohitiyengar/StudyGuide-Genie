Actually, there are no two-dimensional arrays in Java. However, an array can contain any class of object, including an array:It's not exactly equivalent to two-dimensional arrays because the size of the sub-arrays may vary. The sub-array reference can even be null. Consider:Note that the length of a two-dimensional array is the number of one-dimensional arrays it contains. In the above example, weirdTwoDimArray.length is 3, whereas weirdTwoDimArray[2].length is 5.In the code section 3.58, we defined an array that has three elements, each element contains an array having 5 elements. We could create the array having the 5 elements first and use that one in the initialize block.Test your knowledge Question 3.21: Consider the following code: Question 3.21: The alphabet. 
1 String[][] alphabet = {{"a", "b", "c", "d", "e"},
2                           {"f", "g", "h", "i", "j"},
3                           {"k", "l", "m", "n", "o"},
4                           {"p", "q", "r", "s", "t"},
5                           {"u", "v", "w", "x", "y"},
6                           {"z"}};
 Print the whole alphabet in the standard output. Answer Question 3.21: Answer21.java 
 1 public class Answer21 {
 2   public static void main(String[] args) {
 3     String[][] alphabet = {{"a", "b", "c", "d", "e"},
 4                           {"f", "g", "h", "i", "j"},
 5                           {"k", "l", "m", "n", "o"},
 6                           {"p", "q", "r", "s", "t"},
 7                           {"u", "v", "w", "x", "y"},
 8                           {"z"}};
 9 
10     for (int i = 0; i < alphabet.length; i++) {
11       for (int j = 0; j < alphabet[i].length; j++) {
12         System.out.println(alphabet[i][j]);
13       }
14     }
15   }
16 }
 i will be the indexes of the main array and j will be the indexes of all the sub-arrays. We have to first iterate on the main array. We have to read the size of the array. Then we iterate on each sub-array. We have to read the size of each array as it may vary. Doing so, we iterate on all the sub-array items using the indexes. All the items will be read in the right order.
