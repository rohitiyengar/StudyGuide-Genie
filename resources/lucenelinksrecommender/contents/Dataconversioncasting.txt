Data conversion (casting) can happen between two primitive types. There are two kinds of casting:Implicit: casting operation is not required; the magnitude of the numeric value is always preserved. However, precision may be lost when converting from integer to floating point types Explicit: casting operation required; the magnitude of the numeric value may not be preservedThe following table shows the conversions between primitive types, it shows the casting operation for explicit conversions:Unlike C, C++ and similar languages, Java can't represent false as 0 or null and can't represent true as non-zero. Java can't cast from boolean to a non-boolean primitive data type, or vice versa.For non primitive types:
